            <h1>Hello, I'm Shahram Chaudhry.</h1>
            <p> Step into my creative realm! While I could kick things off with the conventional self-introduction—'I am Shahram Chaudhry, a  sophomore from Pakistan, majoring in Computer Science with minors in Interactive Media and Mathematics'—let's take a detour from the ordinary (clever, right?). <br>
                If I was to describe myself in three words they would be analytical, unpredictable, and witty (I am generally not that narcissistic - my friends suggested these adjectives). I generally love to write and travel. Just because I love them doesn't mean I do them a lot, though I have travelled to a few countries from Germany, Switzerland and France to Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia. I am currently based in Abu Dhabi, UAE. <br>
                As for skills, coding, graphic designing, photography and editing are some of my strong pursuits. Go through my projects by clicking the next button and unravel the mysteries surrounding me!
