        <p id="text1">Hosting the 30MFF video, my website delves into the Hustle Culture at NYUAD.
            I know my website looks very different from conventional websites, but I wanted to make a website that would
            stand out. The website adopts a board-and-sticky-notes theme for a distinctive and engaging visual experience.

        </a>
        <p id="text2"> The interactive comic is based on what humans find during their space mission (Don't expect me to tell you, go find out youself!). I would say that this comic also best showcases my sense of humour (my friends like to add the word
            dark, but whatever).

        <p id="text3">The type of days when you oversleep, go to class and find out you have a quiz that you are about to fail>>>.
            I know right. This audio experience talks about days like these - indeed the 'lucky' days.

            Don't worry, I just made it up. It stands for 'Solve The Crime With Me.' Enjoy the 
            deadly comedy-crime documentary combo! How can these words be in the same sentence? Well, find out for yourself.
